# Lemon Cake
  
## ingredients
Lemon Cake:
* 1 (18.25 oz) package lemon cake mix
* 1 (3.4 oz) package instant lemon pudding mix
* 1 3/4 c. water
* 3 egg whites

Lemon Frosting:  
* 6 TBS flour
* 1 c. whole milk
* 1 c. salted butter
* 1 c. granulated sugar (not powdered)
* 2 tsp lemon extract
* 1 1/2-2 TBS lemon zest
* optional: yellow food coloring

## steps
Lemon Cake:
1. Preheat oven to 350°. Grease and flour two 8-9 inch round pans.
2. Mix together cake mix and pudding mix.
3. Pour in water and egg whites; beat on low speed for one minute.
4. Increase speed to high and beat for four minutes.
5. Pour batter into prepared pans. (batter weighs ~2 lb, 3 oz)
6. Bake at 350° for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.
7. Allow to cool completely.

For Cupcakes:
1. Fill cupcakes 3/4 full, rather than 2/3 full
2. Bake ~20 minutes; makes 24 cupcakes

Lemon Frosting:
1. Whisk together the flour and the milk; heat in a small sauce pan on medium heat. Whisk continuously until it starts to thicken; Let it cook, while stirring with a rubber spatula, until you can start to see the bottom of the pan. Continue to cook until mixture has the consistency of thick pudding or paste.
2. Put mixture in the fridge and let it cool completely. It's fine if it stays in there long enough to get chilly, you just don't want it warm at all. As it's cooling, feel free to stir it occasionally to speed up the process and keep it from forming a crust on top.
3. In an electric stand mixer, beat the butter and the sugar for a minute or two until well combined and fluffy. You'll want to use the whisk attachment instead of a flat paddle. While beating, add in the thickened milk miture and the lemon extract. Beat to combine and then scrape down the sides. Mixture will separate and look messy; keep beating!
4. Continue beating until mixture comes together and is light and fluffy, about 7-8 minutes. Take a sample of frosting between your fingers; frosting is done when light and fluffy and sugar granules are dissolved.
5. Optional: add yellow food coloring one drop at a time until frosting reaches desired color.
6. Mix in lemon zest.

# Thai Green Curry

## ingredients  
*  1 medium onion, diced
*  1-2 tablespoons ghee or coconut oil
*  2-3 tablespoons (or to taste) Fish Sauce
*  1-2 tablespoons (or to taste) Green Curry Paste
*  optional: 1-2 tsp freshly ground cardamom
*  1 can coconut milk
*  1 can baby corn, drained
*  1 can bamboo shoots, drained
*  1-2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, sliced in very thin strips
*  1 medium potato, diced
*  Basmati rice

## steps
1. Heat ghee or oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add diced onion, fish sauce and curry paste. (Optional: add 1-2 tsp freshly ground cardamom with the curry paste)
2. Cook until onions are soft and paste is de-clumpified. If needed, add a little coconut milk to the onion mix to help get the paste smooth.
3. Add coconut milk, baby corn and bamboo shoots; bring to a boil.
4. Add thinly sliced chicken breast and diced potatoes; bring back to a boil; turn heat down and simmer about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, til potatoes are tender and chicken is cooked through.

* Serve over basmati rice. Sometimes I like to add a bunch of ground cinnamon in with the rice as it cooks. Or try using a cinnamon stick.

## notes  
* I use frozen chicken breasts and thaw them for 45 seconds on each side in the microwave right before slicing them. Using partially frozen chicken breasts is the best way I have found to slice the chicken evenly and super thin.

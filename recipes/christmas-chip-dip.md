# Christmas Chip Dip

## ingredients
* 8 oz cream cheese
* 12 oz cottage cheese
* 12 oz sour cream
* up to 12 oz Miracle Whip
* canned tiny shrimp, crab, or both
* catsup
* tabasco sauce

* Ruffles wavy chips

## steps  
1. In a large bowl, use a fork to drag the cream cheese up the sides of the bowl. This allows the cream cheese to remain "chunky" in the dip.
2. Stir in cottage cheese, sour cream, and Miracle Whip (not mayo). Scrape sides of bowl while stirring.
3. Add canned shrimp, reserving all the juice in case the dip needs thinned out.
4. Add catsup for color.
5. Add tabasco for heat.

# Creamy White Chili 

## ingredients
* 1 lb. boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
* 1 medium onion, chopped
* 1 1/2 tsp. garlic powder or 2 cloves fresh garlic, finely minced
* 1 TBS oil
* 2 cans (15.5oz each) Great Northern Beans, rinsed and drained
* 1 can (14.5oz) chicken broth
* 2 cans (4oz each) chopped green chilies (if you like less kick, add just one can)
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tsp ground cumin
* 1 tsp dried oregano
* 1/2 tsp pepper
* 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
* 1 cup sour cream (maybe try Crema Mexicana or Crema Oaxaqueña)
* 1/2 cup whipping cream
* Fresh cilantro, for garnish (optional) 

## steps
1. In a large saucepan, sauté chicken, onion, and garlic powder (or fresh garlic, if using) in oil until chicken is no longer pink.
2. Add beans, broth, chilies, and seasonings.
3. Bring to a boil.
4. Reduce heat; simmer uncovered for 30 minutes.
5. Remove from the heat; stir in sour cream and cream.
6. Garnish with fresh cilantro, if desired.
7. Serve immediately. 

Slow Cooker Option:
1. In a medium round slow cooker, place 1 pound chicken breasts (fresh or frozen) without cubing them. Add the chopped onion, garlic, beans, green chilies, and all of the spices.
2. Do not add the sour cream or whipping cream yet!
3. Reduce the chicken broth to 12 ounces (about 1 1/2 cups) and pour in over the other ingredients.
4. Stir the mixture around a bit to incorporate the dry spices.
5. Cook on low for 5-7 hours. (If using frozen chicken you'll cook on the longer end of that spectrum. Fresh chicken will cook in less time.)
6. Remove the chicken to a cutting board and shred in bite-sized pieces.
7. Stir chicken back into the slow cooker.
8. In a small bowl or liquid measuring cup, whisk together the sour cream and whipping cream until smooth.
9. Whisk the cream mixture into the crock-pot with the other ingredients.
10. Let the soup cook until heated through; serve.

## notes
* This is especially good served with tortilla chips.

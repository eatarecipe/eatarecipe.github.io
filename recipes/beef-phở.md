# Beef Phở 

## info  
* 30 minutes 
* 6-8 servings  

## ingredients  
* oil
* ½ large yellow onion, cut into strips
* 1 TBS grated ginger
* 6-8 cups water
* 3 TBS Quoc Viet Foods' Beef flavored Phở Soup Base
* spice packet that comes with the soup base (see notes)
* 1 lb. thinly sliced beef (see notes)
* fresh rice stick noodles (found in the refrigerated section)
* mung bean sprouts

Garnishes
* fresh basil, chopped
* green onions, chopped
* Rooster sauce
* limes, quartered
* sliced jalapeños 

## steps  
1. In a pot, carmelize the onions and ginger in oil.
2. Add 6-8 cups water and use a tea infuser and a coffee filter to steep about ½ tablespoon of the spice packet (see notes); bring to a boil.
3. While waiting for water to boil, prepare noodles, meat, and green onions.
4. At boiling, add 3 TBS soup base (or to taste), and stir until contents are dissolved.
5. Add the meat to the boiling water; move to the next step before the meat loses its pink color. It will be very tough if cooked too long.
6. Either cook the rice noodles separately or add them to the boiling pot. Fresh rice stick noodles only take about 90 seconds to cook in boiling water.
7. Remove the infuser and spices from the pot; discard spices.
8. Remove from heat and serve over mung bean sprouts, topping with desired garnishes.

## notes  
* The recipe on my soup base container makes a ginormous batch - using 2 gallons of water. The soup base comes with a couple of spice filter bags. Because I only want to feed 6-8 people, I cut open the filter bags, divide the spices inside into smaller portions, and wrap each portion in its own coffee filter. I place one of one portion of the coffee filter/spices in a tea infuser thing-a-ding, and then submerge the infuser into the water while it's coming to a boil.
* I like to slice the beef when it's between frozen and thawed. Then I let the meat completely thaw before adding it to the broth. This allows me to get a super thin slice of beef that only takes about one minute to cook in the boiling broth, (like meat used in a Japanese hot pot) and it also turns out more tender than would a thicker piece.

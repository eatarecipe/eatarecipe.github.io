# Beef Phở 

## info  
* 30 minutes 
* 6-8 servings  

## ingredients  
* oil
* ½ large yellow onion, cut into strips
* 1 TBS grated ginger
* 6-8 cups water
* 3 TBS Quoc Viet Foods' Beef flavored Phở Soup Base
* spice packet that comes with the soup base (see notes)
* 1 lb. thinly sliced beef (see notes)
* fresh rice stick noodles (found in the refrigerated section)

Garnishes
* mung bean sprouts
* fresh basil, chopped
* green onions, chopped
* Rooster sauce
* limes, quartered
* sliced jalapeños 

## steps  
1. In a pot, carmelize the onions and ginger in oil.
2. Add 6-8 cups water and use a tea infuser and a coffee filter to steep about ½ tablespoon of the spice packet (see notes); bring to a boil.
3. While waiting for water to boil, prepare noodles, meat, and garnishes.
4. At boiling, add 3 TBS soup base (or to taste), and stir until contents are dissolved.
5. Place rice noodles in a mesh colander that can be lowered into the boiling broth. Lower the noodles in the broth for about 60-90 seconds; stir noodles in the colander a couple of times so they cook evenly. Remove noodles and pour into a serving bowl; set aside.
6. Add the meat to the broth. Remove pot from the heat before the meat loses its pink color. It will be very tough if cooked too long, plus it will continue to cook even after removed from the heat.
7. Serve soup over the noodles, topping with desired garnishes.

## notes  
* The recipe on my soup base container makes a ginormous batch; using 2 gallons of water. The soup base comes with a couple of spice filter bags. Because I only want to feed 6-8 people, I cut open the filter bags, divide the spices inside into smaller portions, and wrap each portion in its own coffee filter. I place one of one portion of the coffee filter/spices in a tea infuser thing-a-ding, and then submerge the infuser into the water while it's coming to a boil.
* I like to slice the beef when it's between frozen and thawed. Then I let the meat completely thaw before adding it to the broth. This allows me to get a super thin slice of beef that only takes about one minute to cook in the boiling broth, (like meat used in a Japanese hot pot) and it also turns out more tender than would a thicker piece.
* The Rice noodles may be cooked in a separate pot using boiling water. I prefer the flavor of the noodles when they are cooked in the broth, so I started using a mesh colander lowered into the broth so the noodles can be removed quickly before adding the meat. If left in the pot while cooking the meat, the noodles will be over-cooked and mushy.

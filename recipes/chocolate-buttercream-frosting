# Chocolate Buttercream Frosting

## ingredients
* 1/2 c. butter, softened
* 3 1/2 c. powdered sugar (14 oz)
* 1/3 c. unsweetened cocoa powder
* 1/4 c. hot cream
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 1 tsp salt (or vanilla bean salt)

## steps  
1. Cream the butter.
2. Mix in all other ingredients. Add more cream if too thick.
  
## notes  
* It may take a 1.5 or double frosting recipe to cover one layered cake.
* Top with chocolate curls and/or a couple of pinches of vanilla bean salt.
* Sometimes I don't bother with the hot cream and use whole milk instead.

* 1 lb 5 oz powdered sugar
* 1/3 + 2 1/2 TBS cocoa (1 3/8oz)

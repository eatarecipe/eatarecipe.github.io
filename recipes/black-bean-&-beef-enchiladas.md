## notes  
* Arrel told me that if an herb or spice smells like it should go in the recipe, the final product will probably taste good. The first time I made this recipe I just smelled stuff I found in my mother-in-law's cupboards and added it during step 3. It tasted good so I wrote down all the stuff I used that day.

## based on  
* This is most likely based on a recipe from the label on a can of Rosarita Enchilada Sauce.

## ingredients
* 3 TBS butter
* olive oil
* 1 1/2 c. chopped yellow onion
* 3/4 c. chopped shallots (2 large)
* 1 c. chopped leek, white and light green parts, spun-dried
* 3 (28-oz) cans crushed tomatoes

* grated parmesan cheese, for garnish
* minced fresh basil, for garnish

## steps  
1. Heat butter and olive oil in large pot over medium-low heat.
2. Add the onion, shallots, and leek; saute for 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender.
3. Add the tomatoes, milk, cream, saffron, red pepper flakes, 1 TBS salt, and 1 1/2 tsp black pepper.
4. Raise the heat, bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer uncovered for 30-40 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the flavors are blended and the soup is slightly thickened.
5. Off the heat, stir in 1 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp black pepper.
6. Serve hot, sprinkled with the parmesan and basil.
        

## notes  
* Make ahead: Prepare the soup completely and refrigerate. Reheat over medium-low heat, adding milk or water as needed to make the soup the desired consistency.

## based on  
* Ina Garten's recipe from her book: Modern Comfort Food. Her recipe calls for parsley instead of basil as a garnish, but fresh parsley from the store is usually gross. It also suggests San Marzano crushed tomatoes, but I used a no-name brand which tasted fine to me.
